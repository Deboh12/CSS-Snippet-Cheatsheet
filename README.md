# CSS-Snippet-Cheatsheet

## Description
The CSS-Snippet-Cheatsheet is a user-friendly web app serving as a knowledge base for CSS snippets. Motivated by the need for a quick CSS reference, it offers a visually appealing and responsive platform. The project goes beyond a typical assignment, aiming to be a practical tool for developers, especially those learning CSS.

It effectively solves the problem of forgetting or struggling with specific CSS syntax by providing a centralized location for storing and retrieving snippets. Users can easily identify, copy, and integrate CSS code, streamlining development.

Through the project, hands-on experience was gained with HTML, CSS variables, flexbox, media queries, and various CSS properties. The collaborative nature of the project also fostered teamwork and communication skills, contributing to a well-rounded learning experience.

## Usage
1. Explore the collection of CSS snippets organized in a responsive grid.
2. Click on any snippet to highlight and copy the CSS code.
3. View the application on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) to experience the responsive design.
